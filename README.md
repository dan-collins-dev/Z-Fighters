# Week 10 Deliverable

## Overview

This assignment is a deliverable for [Code:You](https://code-you.org/)'s Software Development with C# pathway. In this assignment we were to create simple program that should:

```
- Consumes a JSON file that contains at least one array of object values.
- Iterates over that array of objects and displays the contents of those objects.
```

To add additional challenges, the JSON file is not only read, but added fighters can be saved to the file.
